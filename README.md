## Notes

One major hurdle was implementing Android’s Navigation Component for the first time. Transitioning from a single-screen activity to a multi-fragment structure meant restructuring the app’s architecture, updating layouts, and ensuring every fragment was properly registered in the navigation graph. Early crashes occurred when fragment class names and package paths didn’t match the navigation graph, and resolving these mismatches required close attention to detail.
